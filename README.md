‚òû Github Actions to create pull request using Github CLI ‚§µÔ∏è

_**Note**: This action is supported on **all runners** operating systems (`ubuntu`, `macos`, `windows`)_

_Inspired from [https://github.com/repo-sync/pull-request](https://github.com/repo-sync/pull-request)_

_Original Code from [github.com/GuillaumeFalourd/pull-request-action](https://github.com/GuillaumeFalourd/pull-request-action)_

## üìù Features

- Create pull requests

- Add reviewers, assignees, labels, or milestones

- Customize pull request title and body

- Fail silently when a pull request already exists

## üìö Usage

- This action uses [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to create a Pull Request.

- [According to the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/using-github-cli-in-workflows), to authenticate on the workflow using Github CLI, you need to set the GITHUB_TOKEN context variable as environment variable.

- Note that if you need specific permissions, you can also set a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) instead.
